Monsters VS Monster Girls - Game Idea

Summary of Premise: A long time ago, there was much evil in the world. God decided He would punish humanity for its wickedness, and so He set a curse on humanity. The most wicked of them all revealed the true nature of their hearts in their new monstrous forms. But only in those girls with the purest of hearts, the transformation was incomplete. Now envied and hated in a world of monsters, the monster girls banded together to survive and vanquish evil!

Possible Genre List:
Likely:
 
Turn Based Strategy RPG

* This genre seems to make the most sense for a game with a premise like this. It would be easy and simple to do, with one team, the player's team, being the team of monster girls, and the other team being the team of monsters. At no point would players ever have control of the monsters themselves; the monster girls are an appropriate proxy.
* A caveat of this genre is the ability to introduce multitudes of characters that can play a role in the story, like Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics. I originally intended for there to be a large number of monster girls involved with the players.

Standard RPG

* It may be closer to a JRPG in terms of style.
* One of the only significant drawbacks is the fact that most RPGs typically don't have huge casts of characters that join the party. I intend to introduce many playable monster girls.
* The main character can get a larger role in the story and become more involved, and could be easily worked into the plot.
* Progression would be largely linear if it's a JRPG.

Card Game

* If it's a computerized card game, the computer opponents (similarly to Kancolle) would be in control of monster cards for the monster girl cards to face.
* The biggest problem with the card game genre for this game is lack of a narrative. I intend to have a plot for the game.

Beat'em Up Game

* The allied army troops would be generic monster girls that can serve as cannon fodder (mostly beast girls), and the enemy army would be typical monsters such as goblins, orcs, kobolds, etc.
* I imagine the game would probably have to be 3D in order for it to be familiar to most beat'em up fans, but it can probably be 2D or isometric as well (a la Diablo).

Unlikely (because they don't work even if they might otherwise make sense):

Fighting Game

* It would be weird for a game like this to be a fighting game because the premise of the game is monster girls vs monsters. It wouldn't make sense to allow you to play as regular monsters.
* If the game were popular enough or if I felt like it, a later game in the series could be a fighting game.

Shoot'em Up Game

* Despite my love for Touhou, this genre just wouldn't work for Monsters VS Monster Girls unless there are very few monster girls that you could play. Many monster girls would be too awkward as playable characters, including centaur girls (flying centaur girls?).

Cast:
Main Cast:
Vampire Girl (Tentative Name)
Vengeful and driven by her goals. After the tragedies that has befallen her and her family, it's hard to blame her. She can be a bit mean-spirited and cold-hearted due to this, although she is otherwise quite compassionate.

Cyclops Girl (Tentative Name)
Optimistic and caring. She is the heart of the group and is typically seen smiling despite the fact that even in her human days, she was an orphan. She's possibly the only character in the group that really understands Vampire Girl.

Slime Girl (Tentative Name)
Really shy and embarrassed of her appearance. She has a really low self-esteem and may start tearing up if she's pressured. Blushes a lot and is at a loss at trying to explain herself when she does something wrong.

Witch Girl (Tentative Name)
Analytical and difficult to understand. She is quite aloof and snarky due to her intelligence. She is best known for her theories that attempt to explain why families tend to turn into the same monsters.

Harpy Girl (Tentative Name)
Outgoing and loves to be the center of attention. She loves to sing but feels as though her singing voice is underappreciated, despite the large number of fans she has. She is constantly trying to improve her singing voice and can be very diligent.

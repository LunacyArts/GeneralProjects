A boy/girl walks through the door.
"I guess it's time to head to the baracks this morning."
The young warrior heads to the baracks to meet his master.
The young warrior is a squire in training to be a knight.
His mission for the day is to accompany his master, one of the head knights to a nearby mountain.

They regain conciousness to find that they are alone and the knight and mage are missing
They must escape the mountain alone
